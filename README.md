# respdetect

### Summary
Respdetect is a MATLAB toolkit to detect respirations in whale DTAG records. The tools are especially useful for detecting respiration events using movement signatures in logging whales, in addition to single-breath surfacings. Respdetect exports the locations and type (single-breath surfacing or logging) of all detected breaths.
