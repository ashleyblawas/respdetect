## Welcome

Pull requests, bug reports, and all other forms of contribution are welcomed and encouraged!

## Code of Conduct

Before contributing, please read the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) and be sure to adhere to these expectations when making a contribution to the repository. 

## Before You Start

Before you start contributing, ensure the following:

* Please do not debug your specific project in GitHub issues (instead use it for filing bugs and feature requests). If you have a question specific to your application, please contact me via email at ashleyblawas@gmail.com.
* Check that you are using the latest version of the project as not to work on outdated code.
* Search through existing issues to see if your issue has previously been reported. If so, comment with any additional information you have and/or indicate that you have this problem too which will make it higher priority to fix.

## Contribution Workflow

### Fork and clone repository

GitHub provides a useful guide to forking and cloning which you can find [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop).

### Report issues and bugs

 - Double check that this issue has not already been reported.
   
 - Provide sufficient detail to allow the bug to be reproduced including system details (OS, MATLAB version, etc.) as well as a full description and screenshots/videos of the bug when applicable.

### Pull requests

*Note: All contributions will be licensed under the project's license.*

- Limit pull request to one per bug fix or feature. When doing so, do not reformat code that is unrelated to your change.

- For larger changes, try to open an issue to discuss a strategy with the repository maintainer to ensure this doesn't duplicate ongoing efforts.

- Include the ability to test new functionality when possible.

- Keep coding styles and conventions as consistent as possible.

- Add documentation. Document your changes with code doc comments or in existing guides.
