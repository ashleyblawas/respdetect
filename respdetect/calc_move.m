function calc_move(fs, Aw, p, pitch, roll, head, movement_fname)
    % CALC_MOVE Computes movement metrics from accelerometer and orientation data.
    %
    %   This function processes tri-axial acceleration (Aw) and orientation
    %   signals (pitch, roll, head) to calculate various movement metrics,
    %   including filtered signals, derivatives, jerk, and Shannon entropy-based
    %   features. The results are saved to a `.mat` file specified by the user.
    %
    %   Inputs:
    %     fs             - Sampling rate in Hz (scalar)
    %     Aw             - Nx3 matrix of acceleration data [surge, sway, heave]
    %     p              - Nx1 pressure or depth vector (used for reference)
    %     pitch          - Nx1 pitch angle (radians or degrees)
    %     roll           - Nx1 roll angle
    %     head           - Nx1 heading angle
    %     movement_fname - String name of output .mat file where results are saved
    %
    %   Outputs:
    %     None (results are saved to 'movement_fname' file)
    %
    %   Movement metrics calculated:
    %     - Filtered acceleration signals (2â€“15 Hz bandpass or >2 Hz highpass)
    %     - Derivatives (diff) of acceleration and orientation
    %     - Shannon entropy of derivatives
    %     - Smoothed entropy over 5-second moving window
    %     - Jerk (time derivative of acceleration vector)
    %
    %   The function handles NaNs in the input data by filtering only the valid
    %   segments and reintroducing NaNs to preserve original data length.
    %
    %   Example:
    %     calc_move(50, Aw, p, pitch, roll, head, "results/movement_metrics.mat");
    %
    %   Assumptions:
    %     - The input vectors are all the same length.
    %     - NaNs represent invalid data points and are handled internally.
